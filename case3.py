I had some trouble doing this one. I thought in a absolutely incorrect
approach, so I decided to search for it. I found a solution online, that looks
kinda like the problem, but only works for positive integers. This is it:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-length-of-longest-fibonacci-like-subsequence/
Since it is not my code, I decided not to implement it, but I decide to show
that I could find something similar.
